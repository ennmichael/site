# typescript-game-of-life

Left click to toggle weather a cell at a certain position is alive, enter to start the simulation.

## Running

If you wish to run the game offline, it's enough to `clone` the repo and open game.html in your favourite browser.
if you wish to run the game on localhost, `clone` and do `node ./compiled/index.js`. Port is 8000.

## Modifying

Since the original code is written in typescript and then compiled to JS, the JS code might look a little obfuscated.
To modify original typescript you might want to `npm install @types/node --save-dev`.
